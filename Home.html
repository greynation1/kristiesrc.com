			Hello, my name is Dexter. I am a miniature, long-haired, red-dapple dachshund "weiner dog".
			I was born on January 26, 2008 and I met my family in early March of 2008. 
			I live with my owners David and Kristie Mason in Birmingham Alabama, but soon I 
			will be moving to Auburn with my parents to live with my best friend Tuna. I like 
			to run and eat and love anyone who will let me. I have never bitten anyone
			and am on my way to being a well behaved puppy. 
			</br></br>I began my life a purebred miniature
			dachshund at a kennel in Louisville Mississippi. When I was old enough to leave my mother
			I was brought to a pet shop in Hoover Alabama; Wags to Riches. That is where 
			I was discovered by my loving owners. After some persuasion by Kristie at the
			Baumhaurs Wings next door David agreed that I was the dog for them. One day, after 
			a couple of months with Kristie and David, they took me to Jan and Richards 
			and I didn't see them for a whole week. Aparently they got married and didn't 
			tell me they were going on their honeymoon. All was well when they got back though
			they brought me a genuine Mexican sombrero. Soon after that they started taking me to
			Petsmart puppy training classes. They are a lot better at communicating with me now. 
			These days I spend a lot of time chilling in the kitchen while they are at work and 
			then going crazy when they get home. I dont know why I just get these sudden urges to 			
			run around like a mad dog. They get a kick out of it. Well if you want to know more 	
			check out the rest of my pages. <img src="images/paw2.jpg">
